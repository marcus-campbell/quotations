I am a shameless collector of quotations. Here are my favourites, ordered alphabetically by each author's surname. I have checked each entry to ensure that it was actually said by the person that it is attributed to, and eventually I will add actual references. A few entries have been paraphrased slightly in order to improve their clarity in present-day English.

I am a shameless collector of quotations. Here are my favourites, ordered alphabetically by surname. I have checked each entry to ensure that it was actually said by the person that it is attributed to, and at some point I will add actual references. A few entries have been slightly paraphrased in order to improve their clarity in present-day English.
